<!-- THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE SERVER, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE OF THESE IN client/ -->

## TO DO 

1. reinstate websockets, to be able to send messages to decrement amount left in keg to effect SVG in UI
  - then create terminal app to "pour" beers, thus emptying the keg amount left
  
### TO PONDER

1. create and send a hash from beer name, type, and brewery name along with the beers for use in the client for robohash images
  - just to use crypto packages in rust, no other real reason
